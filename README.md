Build a shopping website like Amazon. 
After signup, customers can add addresses and select a default address for delivery. 
When customers login, they can browse goods, check their descriptions, pictures, prices, write or check reviews. 
After adding items into a cart, customers can edit the amount they want to purchase, check or remove items in the cart and submit them as an order. 
Orders with order details such as date, total cost and information about each item can be checked and customers can also return purchased items after they submit reasons. 

The technologies used are Python(Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic), Javascript(React, Redux) and Postgres.
